\section{Principal Component Analysis}

\subsection{Introduction}

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a successful dimensionality reduction 
algorithm, whose central output is a set of basis vectors in a reduced dimension.
These basis vectors are the eigenvectors corresponding to $k$\footnote{If input feature $x$ is of dimension $n$, the output of PCA is a reduced subspace of dimension $k$ such that ideally $k$ \textless $n$.} largest eigenvalues of the Covariance matrix of input Data.

It is a Generative Algorithm\footnote{A Generative Algorithm learns joint probability distribution for input data $x$ and labels $y$ as $p(x,y)$ whereas a Discriminative Algorithm learns conditional probability distribution $p(y|x)$.} and hence can be used for 
reconstruction. This property is further used for classification.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



\subsection{Eigenfaces}\label{EigenFaces}

In the following section, two methods (varying in computation complexity)
are demonstrated for applying PCA to input face data.

The input face data is partitioned into a training and test set in the ratio
of 4:1 respectively. This ratio has been proven to be a good rule of thumb. It is also made sure that training set contains some examples of each class.

\subsubsection{PCA: computationally intensive method}\label{pca_poor_method}

In this section, the Covariance matrix $S$ is calculated as follows.
\begin{equation}
S_{2576\times2576}=\frac{1}{N}(X_{2576\times 416}\times X^T) \label{computationally_intensive_covariance}
\end{equation}

\iffalse
\begin{equation}
$$\underset{2576\times 2576}S=\frac{1}{N}*(\underset{2576\times 416}X*X^T)$$
\end{equation}
\fi

PUT THIS AS EQUATION CAPTION- $X$ is mean-centered\footnote{mean along each dimension of the input data matrix is calculated and subtracted from input matrix for all observations.} input data matrix.
	$N$ is total number of observations.

\end{figure}
\fi

The mean image\footnote{This image is obtained by reshaping mean vector into a matrix of size $46\times56$. Henceforth all images will be of this dimension unless stated otherwise.} is shown in \figref{mean_image}

\subsubsection*{Decomposing Covariance matrix}\label{decomp_cov_matrix}
The Covariance matrix is calculated as shown above, and 
then Matlab SVD command is used to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues
of the matrix.

The first ten eigenvectors are shown in \figref{eigenvectors}. Each eigenvector 
accounts for a set of features that characterize variations among input faces.

Eigenvalues after $N-1$, where $N$ is the number of observations, are very close to zero and hence these eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors are discarded. This is because {\bf TODO: EXPLAIN THIS.}

\subsubsection*{Heuristic for choosing dimension $k$}

After obtaining non-zero eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors 
through the process shown above, a heuristic is required to choose 
the dimension of the resultant subspace, which should be lesser than that of the input data.\footnote{The input data after partitioning,as explained in section 1.2 is of size $2576\times416$ in this coursework. PCA aims to determine a value $k$ \textless $416$.}

The value of $k$ is determined by looping over values from 1 to the number of data samples. In each iteration the ratio $$ Reconstruction Error/Variance $$ is computed, and if it falls below a certain threshold,
the loop is terminated and the value of $k$ is the final result.

{\bf TODO: More details on the algorithm are placed in the Appendix.}

For a threshold of WHAT
The resultant value found using the heuristic is $k = something$.
The output of PCA is a set of basis vectors $W$ given by - $$W_{2576 \times k} = first\: k\: eigenvectors\: of\: S$$
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=2\linewidth,angle=-90,scale=0.4]{./images/eigenvectors.eps}}
    \end{center}
   \caption{First ten eigenvectors of covariance matrix. They look like ghostly faces and are also called eigenfaces.}
\label{fig:eigenvectors}
\end{figure}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{PCA: Efficient method}\label{pca_efficient_method}

In this section, the Covariance matrix $S$ is calculated as follows.
\begin{equation}
S_{416\times 416}=\frac{1}{N}(X^T\times X_{2576\times 416}) \label{fast_covariance}
\end{equation} 

Comparing dimension of $S$ in equation (\ref{fast_covariance}) with $S$ in equation (\ref{computationally_intensive_covariance}), it is clear that this method is much faster than the
previous method.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed as explained in section \ref{decomp_cov_matrix}. It is found that the eigenvalues thus computed are the same as first $N-1$ eigenvalues computed in section {\ref{decomp_cov_matrix}}. The eigenvectors are related by \[ a_{2576 \times 1} = X_{2576 \times 416} \times b_{416 \times 1,} \]
where $a$ refers to an eigenvector calculated as in \ref{pca_poor_method}, $b$ refers to an eigenvector calculated as in \ref{pca_efficient_method} and $X$ is training data.

It is important to normalize the eigenvectors $a$ obtained in this method
since they need to be basis vectors with unit magnitude.

\subsection{Application of Eigenfaces}

In the following section, input face images are reconstructed using results(eigenvectors) from PCA. This property is further used for classification of test images.

\subsubsection{Face Image Reconstruction}

The theoretical Reconstruction error $J$ is given by 
\begin{equation} J = \sum_{i=k+1}^N eigenvalues
\label{theoretical_error}
\end{equation}

The practical Reconstruction error is given by 
\begin{equation} 
P = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N |x_n - x_{n_Reconstructed}|^2 
\label{practical_error}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth,scale=0.1]{./images/reconError_vs_k.eps}}
    \end{center}
   \caption{Reconstruction error is inversely proportional to $k$.}
   \label{fig:recon_error}
\end{figure}

It is found that both (\ref{theoretical_error}) and (\ref{practical_error}) lead to same reconstruction error. An example of 3 reconstructed images
from training images is given in \figref{reconstructed_training_data}.

{\bf AN EXAMPLE FOR TEST IMAGES IS PLACED IN APPENDIX SECTION <>}

   \caption{The upper row contains face images from training set and lower row contains corresponding reconstructed images with $k$ = 124.
}
   \label{fig:reconstructed_training_data}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{PCA-based Classification}

In this section, PCA is used for classification of images using the procedure from 
slide 23 of PRlecturefacesubspace.

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be
found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.  For conference
submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the
reviewer to go to a techreport for further details.  Thus, you may say in
the body of the paper ``further details may be found
in~\cite{Authors14b}''.  Then submit the techreport as additional material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material. 

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool which
is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.  For example,
let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander,
and you believe that the CVPR70 audience would like to hear about your
solution.  The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled
``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to
the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

You can handle this paper like any other.  Don't write ``We show how to
improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].  This time we tested the
algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors. Instead
write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.  This
   system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] didn't
   handle case B properly.  Ours handles it by including
   a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo
   lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't
   you know.  It displayed the following behaviours
   which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
\end{quotation}
As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention,
reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as
the authors.  A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was
written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been
contracted to solve problem B.

FAQ: Are acknowledgements OK?  No.  Leave them for the final copy.

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
following is correct: ``
   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.

\section{Support Vector Machine}

\subsection{Introduction}
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a highly successful Binary Classification algorithm.
It is a supervised learning algorithm.

\subsection{Multi-Class Extension for SVM}
In this section, Multi-class extension of SVM is explored using one-vs-all and one-vs-one methods and then classification results are compared with PCA-based classification.

The input data partition is the same as used in section \ref{EigenFaces}.

\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
high.
Page numbers should be in footer with page numbers, centered and .75
inches from the bottom of the page and make it start at the correct page
number rather than the 4321 in the example.  To do this fine the line (around
line 23)
\begin{verbatim}
%\ifcvprfinal\pagestyle{empty}\fi
\setcounter{page}{4321}
\end{verbatim}
where the number 4321 is your assigned starting page.

Make sure the first page is numbered by commenting out the first page being
empty on line 46
\begin{verbatim}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
\end{verbatim}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to
be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is,
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank
lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in
Figures~\ref{fig:onecol} and~\ref{fig:short}.  Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction})
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements})
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period
and your text on the same line.
